# J2RM (JSON-to-RDF Mappings): Domain Ontology Graph (D.O.G.) Creation

## What is J2RM?

* J2RM is a tool to process mappings from JSON data to RDF triples guided by an OWL2 ontology structure.
* The mappings are defined as annotation properties associated with each ontology entity of interest.
* They are embedded in an ontology file so that they can be readily deployed and shared to automate RDF-graph creation.
